# Array transformations

This code demonstrates a few techniques for transforming arrays using both
the native `Array.prototype` methods, as well as generators and Ramda.

**NOTE:** Ramda version is slow in this test, but please take it with a big
grain of salt. I'm not an expert in transducers. It's simply included here
because I was curious.

## Running the code

Install the dependencies with `yarn` or `npm install` and run with NodeJS:
`node transform.js`.
